This is the first post to a new blog!

Mostly this is just a test post to make sure that I've correctly setup this part of my jekyll site. I've quite enjoyed creating it, between jekyll and Github Pages it is a very comfortable way to create a website! Especially since all I needed was a simple page to hold my thoughts on my hobbies and my resume, etc.
