We recently wrapped up a local move to a new house. It was somewhat unexpected, but the right opportunity presented itself to us to move into a home the right size for our growing family. However, wow, moving with a preschooler and a baby so very hard.

My wife and I were very stressed during this time. Having two kids presents natural challenges to the amount of time available for chores and getting things done. For about a month, this entire "free time" was consumed by packing, for little bits at a time every day. Of course, having boxes everywhere and all the stuff disappearing will stress out any two year old, making their emotions come out on a hair trigger. We realized we have hit all three major life changes within the last twelve months: a new job, a new baby, and now a new house. We are hoping for a clear summer.

After all the turmoil, setting in to the new home felt just right. We have a large list of fixes we want to do, but we feel so comfortable here. We bought the house despite the adjoining open space being slated for a new housing development, which would mean construction and losing being at the end of the dead-end street. However, we were truly blessed to hear that the whole development was withdrawn, less than two weeks after we moved in! We expect the development plans kept other interested buyers away; we are not sure we would have been able to buy the house without that. Someday, something will be constructed next door, there is no doubt, but this should allow a few years before that happens.

Part of moving meant selling our previous house. There isn't much to say about it other than selling never seems to be as smooth as you expect, going into the process. There were more speedbumps and hiccups than we could have predicted. But that all seems to be in the rear-view mirror, and we are excited to be where we are!
