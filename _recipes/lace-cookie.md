|| Ingredients |
|-:|-|
½ C    | finely ground pecans
½ C    | butter
¾ C    | brown sugar
¼ C    | honey
3 Tbsp | flour
½ tsp  | vanilla
¾ C    | chocolate chips

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350.
2. Heat butter, sugar, honey until melted.
3. Add flour, nuts, vanilla.
4. Drop rounded teaspoons onto silpat mat.
   1. Place them three inches apart, perhaps doing only 6 or 8 at a time. They easily run together.
   2. Bake 8-10 mins. 
5. When done, quickly remove silpat mat from baking pan, to cool faster. 
   1. After a couple minutes, they will have hardened enough to move to a wire rack.
6. After all cookies are done and fully cool, make the sandwiches.
   1. Melt chocolate chips in the microwave.
   2. Use a brush to add the layer of chocolate.

### Appendix

* This is rather tedious for the amount of cookies yielded.
