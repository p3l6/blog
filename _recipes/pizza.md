|| Ingredients |
|-:|-|
1 tsp          | instant or rapid rise yeast
3 C            | all purpose or bread flour
2 tsp          | coarse salt, plus extra for sprinkling
1 to 1¼ C      | water
2 Tbsp + 1 tsp | olive oil

## Directions

1. Combine half of the flour with the salt and yeast and stir to blend.
2. Add 1 cup water and 2 tablespoons olive oil; stir with wooden spoon til smooth.
3. Add remaining flour a bit at a time.
   1. When mixture is too stiff to stir with spoon, begin kneading, adding as little flour as possible: just enough to keep it from being a sticky mess.
   2. Knead until smooth but quite moist, about 10 min.
   3. Turn into a dough ball.
4. Grease a bowl with remaining olive oil, place dough in, cover with plastic wrap or damp cloth and let rise in warm area until dough doubles in size (1-2 hrs). Or in the fridge for 6-8 hrs.
