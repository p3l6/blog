## Ingredients
### Filling
* 1 lb Ground beef
* 1 tsp Worcestershire sauce
* 3 Tbsp Onion soup mix (or minced onion)
* 1 C Bread crumbs (or Oatmeal, or a mix)
* 1/2 tsp Nutmeg
* 1/2 C Beef stock
* Salt and pepper to taste

### Pastry
* 1 lb Flour
* 1/2 tsp Salt
* 1 C Hot water
* 1/2 C Butter (or lard)
* Egg

## Directions
1. Combine all ingredients for filling in a bowl
2. Combine flour and salt in a bowl, make a hole in the center
3. Add butter to boiling water, stir to melt
4. Pour water and butter into hole, mix until cool enough to handle
5. Form into a ball, knead on floured board
6. Divide into six pieces, and make crusts with one of the following two methods
	* Set aside and roll out some for a lid. Mold into pan, add filling, cover and crimp with lid. Make a slit in the top for steam
	* Roll out whole piece, form into pan, fold over the excess and crimp together. Leave a couple tiny holes for steam
7. Brush tops with an egg
8. Bake at 250° for 30 minutes. Then 350° for 15 minutes 

*Note* Working with the pans we had, we made them cupcake size. We cut the dough into 18ths. We ran out of filling after about 14. Original baking times worked well. 

*Note* Our small springform pans are the right size to do six, but we only have four, so need to bake in two rounds.
