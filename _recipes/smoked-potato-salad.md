|| Ingredients |
|-:|-|
50/50 mix | mayo, sour cream
&nbsp; | spices?
&nbsp; | shredded cheese

## Directions

1. Double cook potatoes: cut, parboil, bake.
   2. Liquid smoke when boiling?

## Attempt 1

Half bag of potato

Using smoker after parboil, since running anyways. Boiled too long maybe for pre cuts. Might not need to?

1/4 c each mayo cream

1/2 t each
Chili pow
Lawry salt
Paprika
Cayenne
Cumin

1/2 c cheese

Mixed cheese in, then sauce.
Used about 2/3 of sauce.

Results. Good
More cheese would be good. A bit more sauce, but one spice was overpowering it. We think chili powder, leave that out. Maybe less paprika.

## Attempt 2

Full bag of russet potato, peeled, cut to 1in cubes.

Smoker only, no boiling. This was a mistake since the smoker was running cold, and they never cooked. Ended up finishing them on the grill, as we were out of time.

Used .5 C each of mayo and greek yogurt, as we had no sour cream.
1C shredded cheese, I think.
This seemed like the right amount.

For spices, 1t each of: lowry salt, crushed red pepper, cumin. .5t: paprika, garlic.

Overall pretty good, excepting the greek yogurt and grill-charred potatos.
Next time, I would consider par-boiling again, and smoking to finish.
Also, it would be worth trying a small batch by parboiling with liquid smoke and finishing in the air fryer.
