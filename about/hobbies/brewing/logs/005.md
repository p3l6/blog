## Boil

* New large pot
  * inner diameter is 13.5 inches, so $$\frac{231 \frac{in^3}{gal}}{143 {in}^2} = 1.62  \frac{in}{gal}$$
* Using campden tablets to dechloriante.
* Boiling full volume. Steeped grains on stove in small pot. Should have started heating rest of water at the same time.
* This burner looks kinda weak. Might need a better one, more sturdy with legs to the support, for this amount of water and pot size. Also need a better scale, or calibrate this one.
* Pre boil volume: 7 gal
* Adding irish moss @ 15 mins
* accidentally added fuggles @ 15 instead of 10
* Using a whirlpool; cooling in laundry room. lots of hop in the bottom. sStill more liquid in fermenter than before. Need to do a test for volume marks on carboy. In addition to marks on new pot.
* Forgot to record post-boil volume. 1.5 gal of trub left

## Ferment

* Fermenting in pantry, darker. Star san in bubbler.
* OG 1.054
* 27 oct: swapping bubbler for blowtube. Foam all the way up.
* based on carboy markers for brew#6, I estimate 4.5 - 4.75 gallons in fermenter.
* 8 nov: 1.020 may have gotten cold ~62 deg
* 9 nov: 1.019
* 12 nov: 1.019

## Crash

* Adding gelatin at time of moving to keg
* 1tsp per 2/3 C, pasteurized to 150 deg
* cold crashing in keg 1 day before carbonating
* not as much yeast cake as I often see.

## Carb

* Kegged about 4.25 gallons, I think
* 12 nov: Put in keg
* 20 nov: final result is not the best. Doesn't taste much like an ipa. A bit sweet. Probably related to how far off the gravitys were.
