## Recipe

* Chocoalate 500L
* black prinz 500L
* All grain in a bag. Shopped at boulder, lafayette closed at 3pm.

## Mash

* Began warming water at 5:10
* Grains in at 5:45, 154°
* 15min: 152°
* 30 min: 148 heat to 150
* 45min: 152. had left on low
* 60 min: 152
* I stirred at each interval
* I initially filled pot to 7 gal. Removed some prior to grain addition. I don't know the volume loss/gain due to mashing.
* Hole in brew bag. Should not have removed water initially. Had to strain, grains bin liquid. Clarification: Hole not caused by lack of water. Either stirring or thermometer, probably the later. Note: hole on side, not on bottom. If doing BIAB again, devise a way to suspend bag above pot to drain, ie tripod and rope.

## Boil

* Started at 7:37
* Post boil vol: 5.5 gal

## Chill

* Additional research indicates chilling, remove chiller, then whirlpool. I was coming to this conclusiotn myself since it takes forever to chill without stirring.

## Ferment

* Fermenting 4.5gal. Need to have better trub control?
* Next time, move to bucket first. I think the kettle is too wide. Might settle to same height in narrower bucket, with less loss.
* OG 1.066
* 1 nov: swapped to blowoff tube again. next time do it first.
* 15 nov: 1.014
* 23 nov: 1.012 final gravity (7.09%)

## Crash

* Moved fermenter to fridge for cold crashing
* Note: wont fit below shelf with buggler. Using tin foil
* 24 nov: chose not to use gelatine as SRM so dark

## Carb

* 25 nov: transfer to keg and hook up gas. about 3 7/8 gal in keg
* Cleaned tap lines and keg with OKI then starsan rinse
* 1 dec: tapped. It's amazing! Best one yet. Good nose, tastes hearty. Coffee & cocoa hints. Malty.
