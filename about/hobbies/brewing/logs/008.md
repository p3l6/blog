## Mash

* Starting just over 7 gal.
* New burner is great! heated water fast, despite outside temp of 35°
* Strike water to 160°. Added grains, stirred to 154° (target 153°). Pot is inside, blanket wrap
* Temp at 60min: 152°. Thats pretty good.
* Pre boil gravity 1.043. Had to dilute a couple quarts. Need to start with more water.

## Boil

* Moss @ 15
