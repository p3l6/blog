## Starter

* 1.5L with 5.3oz DME, stirring feb 19
* Need to keep bertter watch for _boil overs!_
* Lost about 1/2L to boilovers, adding 1/2 L with 4.2oz LME.

## Mash

* 4 gallons strike at 172. target 158
* sparge with 5.3 gal
* hit 158Â° (third try, had issues with cooler leaking, fortunately, before adding grain.)(using 2 hose washers, instead of o-ring)
* Vorlauf slower seems to work well enough.
* raining took about an hour, but was worth it, it seems clear. Also, pre-boil gravity: 1.048, which seems good, although not states per recipe. pre-boil volume 7 gal.
* Mass efficiency calculated at 75%

## Boil

* whirlfloc @ 15
* end volume: 6.2 gal
* get a spare propane though

## Ferment

* Steel scrubber worked well for transfereing
* 5 1/4 gal in fermenter
* OG 1.054
* 26 feb: 1.020
* 1 mar looking close. Krausen fell.
* 3 mar: 1.012 FG 5.5%
* 4 mar: gelatin, morning. night: moved 5 gal to keg. set to burst 40 psi for 12 hr.
* 6 mar: pretty good. should stabilize a bit more
* used counterpressure filler to fill bottles for NHC.
