## Recipe

A competition held by Mockery Brewery.
They provided 5 gal of marris otter wort.

Adding:
* 5 oz carafoam, steeped
* 8oz german wheat, steeped
* 1.5oz kent goldings (60min)
* WLP005 british ale
* will add chili peppers after primary fermentation

## Starter

* 1.5 L water, 5.3 oz DME. Fermcap in boil (7 drop)
* Heated on gas stove, much better.

## Boil

* Steeping extra grain in 1 gal of water, to also account for boiloff. for 30min at 158°
* Added 3qt water at 5 min to up volume.
* Alternated stirring with a strainer, pulled out a whole bowlful of hop trub while chilling. That worked well. Chilled to <100°
* Transferred to fermenter and chamber ambient set for 62° to finish chilling
* Collected 5.25 gal in fermenter

## Ferment

* 21 mar: pitched yeast (AM) OG 1.061. temp for 67°
* 31 mar: still going... slow yeast? stuck?
* 4 apr: 1.012. Crashing (6.4%)
* 7 apr: transferred to second, with chilis

## Chilis

* Broiled chilies (anahiem) for about 10 minutes, turned over, then another 5 minutes. Turn some more, until black and cracking (total 25 mins)
* Cooled a bit to bag up and freeze

## Conditioning

* 7 apr
* Added 190g chilis, chopped, everything to second fermenter. Racked beer on top. Putting back in cooler to stay at 40°
* Added a couple more a week later.
* 23 apr: kegged
* Ferment chamber note: seem to cool also on the bottom. Should put a pad between cooler and carboy. Also let probe be at bottom/middle instead of top.

## Notes

* Need more grains for head retention. No head. Spice is good. Add more chili at the beginning next time.
