title: Bagpipe Supplies
---

This is a small list of bagpipe products that I like to use, and thoughts about them.

* Bags
  * Bannatyne extended small bag (9.5 x 26.5") bottom zip. The bottom zip makes this the best synthetic bag.
  * Jack Lee sheepskin premium. Great but expensive. My second one lasted a long time, but eventually the grommet corner failed, as the bag cannot be made with a traditional tie in.
  * Gannaway hide. Working great so far, shape is good. The dressing is not as egregious as older and smellier seasonings.
* Tie in wrapping tape
  * Self fusing silicone tape: ie Rescue tape / Duck wrap-fix. This is great for wrapping over top of the metal clamps that come with some bags.
* Blowpipe tubing
  * Silicone tubing, food grade, 1" OD, 3/4" ID. Needs a plastic elbow joint to prevent kinking
  * Standard cpap hose, 19mm ID (discard the 22mm connectors)
* Softybits teeth protectors
* Hemp
  * [Maine thread company, waxed cord](https://www.mainethread.com/index.php/shop/waxed-polycord). Size 30, or in the 25-35 range for an alternate wraps.
  * Yellow waxed is better than black, due to the size
* Chanter tape
  * 3M Vynl tape 471, in half inch or three eigths

## Drone reeds

* MG White mamba
  * Good, sometimes hard to get flat enough in my athertons.
  * Pins might need to be drilled out
* Kinnaird
  * These are really good, especially the edge version, which helps get the right settings for my athertons.
* Canning
  * Great, tend to soak in moisture
  * Small tongues very hard to adjust
  * Havenâ€™t tried blue ones
