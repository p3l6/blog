## Family

I'm living in Apex, NC with my wife, our children (3yr and 6mo), and our dog.

We believe in Jesus and attend a local presbyterian church.

## Work

I am a Software Engineer at CrowdStrike, working on their macOS sensor team.

## Bagpipes

I play with the Wake and District Pipe Band. I serve as the pipe major in the grade 4 competition circle.

I am playing a set of Atherton Legacy pipes, with Kinnaird Edge drone reeds, and a Gannaway pipe bag.

I have developed a custom bagpipe music notation language.
It is similar to ABC notation, but focused specifically on the eccentricities of pipe music.
It has a parser written in swift, [on my github](https://github.com/p3l6/bag-notation), and can be installed with homebrew on mac and linux.

## Other

I am attempting to learn to write in the [shavian alphabet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shavian_alphabet).
