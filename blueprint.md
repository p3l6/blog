This is a description of how this blog is designed and published.

## Privacy

This site does not track, store, transmit, or collect any of your data or personal information. However, various third parties may, including GitHub (hosting) and Google (fonts).

## Built with

* [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com): The static site generator used by default on GitHub Pages. This site has since departed from the default in order to use a newer version and include custom plugins.
* [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com): As css is one of my development nightmares, I wanted to find a higher level abstraction during my latest blog redesign. I chose tailwind and found it very nice to work with.
* [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com): Github pages is a static page hosting service; it serves the Jekyll output from the markdown pages stored in the repository.
* [Repository](https://github.com/p3l6/blog): The repository containing all the content, and history, for this blog. 

## Fonts

* [Comfortaa](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Comfortaa): Headings and navigation
* [Spinnaker](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Spinnaker): Body
* [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode): Code and monospace. I use Fira Code, particularly with the programming ligatures, in all my editors now.

## Layout

The current layout for this blog was _heavily_ inspired by another blog, [Sympolymathesy](https://v5.chriskrycho.com).
