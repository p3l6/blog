> These delicious cookies were served warm at about 4pm when we returned to our clipper ship after an afternoon adventure on zodiacs in Antarctica. Our daughter became such a fan of these cookies that she requested they be served instead of cake at her wedding. I froze the dough in Colorado and baked the cookies in Tortola, BVI. They were a hit! Enjoy! -- Karen Bell
