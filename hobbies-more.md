# Go

I have in the past enjoyed playing Go, although I don't play much anymore. I was around an 8kyu rating when I was playing regularly.


# Homebrewing

**Welcome to Bowline Brewing!** 
I've named my homebrew adventures after my favorite knot, the bowline!
I also try to name each style of beer after a knot as well.

I used to brew in 5 gallon batches every few months, and package into a two tap kegerator mini fridge. I mostly made recipes from the book: _Brewing Classic Styles_.
I used a converted cooler mash tun to brew all grain batches.

All the batches I've made are listed below, with knot names in parentheses when used.

17. **Peach Wheat**: Wheat beer using whole peaches from the palisade peach festival.
16. **Spruce Ale**: Another recipe from the homebrew magazine, using new spruce tips from my neighbor's tree.
15. **Porter (Prusik)**: Remake of the previous porter.
14. **Lime Hefe (Half hitch)**: This one was from the homebrew magazine, made by adding simply limeade to the brew.
13. **Saison (Sheepshank)**: Used a yeast blend from the white labs yeast vault for this.
12. **Cream Ale**: This one was a clone of Terrapin's Golden ale
11. **English Chili Pepper Ale (Hangman's Noose)**: An English blonde ale mashup, with chili peppers. For a contest at Mockery Brewing.
10. **Scottish Ale (Carrick Bend)**: First Submission to a contest.
9. **Smoke Ale**: First time using a starter with a stir plate. Based on something I tried at the White Labs tap room. Followed the Rauchbier recipe, but used WLP003 and fermented as an ale instead of lagering.
8. **Red Ale (Reef Knot)**: First time brewing in the morning instead of afternoon/evening. I'll try to do that again, it was enjoyable.
Used the Irish red ale recipe, but with Imperial Flagship yeast (WLP001). Worked out well.
7. **Extra Special Bitter (Windsor)**: Pretty Good.
6. **Robust Porter (Prusik)**: First beer using all grain, with the brew in a bag method. The best beer I'd made yet, by a long shot.
5. **American Ipa**: First recipe from _Brewing Classic Styles_. Under-fermented and not much at all like an IPA. Very sweet.
4. **Amber Ale**: First Kegged beer! No more bottling! From the Clone book.
3. **Brown Ale**: Moose Drool Clone from the clone book.
2. **Scottish Ale**
1. **Sweet Stout**: The first brew, made with my Father and Brother. Under-carbonated.
