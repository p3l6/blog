A random collection of (appropriate) limericks that I have come across.

I've never seen a purple cow\
I never hope to see one\
But I can tell you anyhow\
I'd rather see than be one

I eat my peas with honey\
I've done it all my life\
It makes the peas taste funny\
But it keeps them on my knife

$$\frac{12+144+20+3\sqrt{4}}{7}+(5\times11) = 9^2 + 0$$

A dozen a gross and a score\
Plus three times the square root of four\
Divided by seven, plus five times eleven\
Is nine squared and not a bit more
