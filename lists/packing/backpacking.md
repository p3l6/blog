  * Last time, took the chaco slippers and it was nice.
  * Next time: replace the five fingers and get something else
* Trek poles could be nice, from REI or black diamond.
  * Helps with hand swelling and going uphill. And bushwacking.
  * Go ahead and get them next time!
* Sleeping pad is leaking. Needs to be patched or replaced.
  * Unable to patch. Need a new one
  * Had “big Agnes insulated air core”
  * Size 20 x 72 x 3.25
